# Overview
A Python script that uses Flask, SQLAlchemy and SQLite to create a to-do app using CRUD operations.

# Description
I decided to build a to-do app to learn more about the fundamental concepts and skills in web development and database interaction. I did quite a bit of research for this project and watched several tutorials online, which included information about the different web frameworks available, how they operate, what database to use to store data, as well as CRUD operations.

Overall, the main things I learned from this project were:
* The concept of a web framework and how to work with one
* Setting up and working within a virtual environment
* Configuring and using Flask and SQLAlchemy
* Handling HTTP requests, routing URL endpoints, and rendering HTML templates with Flask
* Error handling and debugging in a web application context
* Implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing to-do items in the database
* Gaining some familiarity with HTML, although it was not the primary focus of this project for me

I discovered that when working with multiple files within a folder, I needed to employ more error handling and debugging than I had previously. Instead of viewing this as troublesome, I found it satisfying to research and overcome the issues I encountered. It was reassuring to realise that every error I faced had been encountered by many others before me.

This project also provided me with the opportunity to delve deeper into HTML. While my primary focus was not on front-end design, I utilised Semantic UI to enhance the user-friendliness of my interface.

# Languages
* Python
* HTML

# Going Forward
As I continue researching and exploring tutorials on other to-do apps, I'm interested in incorporating the following features into my project:
* User Authentication and Authorisation
* Implementing due dates and reminders for tasks
* Adding sorting and filtering options for better task organization
* Enhancing the HTML and user interface to improve overall aesthetics and usability
